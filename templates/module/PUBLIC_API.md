# Public API — <module-name>

Purpose
- What this module is responsible for.

Public surface (the only allowed cross-module dependency surface)
- APIs exposed to other modules (functions, endpoints, events, messages, files, packages).

Stability rules
- Breaking changes require:
  - migration notes
  - consumer slices in dependent modules
  - integration verification

Versioning (optional)
- If you version the API, describe how.
